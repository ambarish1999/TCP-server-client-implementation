# TCP server client
A simple C++ TCP client server

Both server and client are very easy to use

The code is documented, so I hope you find it easy to change it to suit your needs if needed to.

The server class supports multiple clients.

### Compilation
1. Add pthread library flag
2. If you compile the code with both the example files, comment one of the "main" functions out
